In this paper, we address this problem in an active learning setting where we can spend a given budget on translating in-domain data, and gradually fine-tune a pre-trained out-of-domain NMT model on the newly translated data. Existing active learning methods for NMT usually select sentences based on uncertainty scores, but these methods require costly translation of full sentences even when only one or two key phrases within the sentence are informative. To address this limitation, we re-examine previous work from the phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) era that selected not full sentences, but rather individual phrases. However, while incorporating these phrases into PBMT systems was relatively simple, it is less trivial for NMT systems, which need to be trained on full sequences to capture larger structural properties of sentences unique to the new domain. To overcome these hurdles, we propose to select both full sentences and individual phrases from unlabelled data in the new domain for routing to human translators. In a German-English translation task, our active learning approach achieves consistent improvements over uncertainty-based sentence selection methods, improving up to 1.2 BLEU score over strong active learning baselines.",

However, existing machine translation benchmarks have been mostly limited to high-resource or well-represented languages. Despite an increasing interest in low-resource machine translation, there are no standardized reproducible benchmarks for many African languages, many of which are used by millions of speakers but have less digitized textual data. To tackle these challenges, we propose AfroMT, a standardized, clean, and reproducible machine translation benchmark for eight widely spoken African languages. We also develop a suite of analysis tools for system diagnosis taking into account the unique properties of these languages. Furthermore, we explore the newly considered case of low-resource focused pretraining and develop two novel data augmentation-based strategies, leveraging word-level alignment information and pseudo-monolingual data for pretraining multilingual sequence-to-sequence models. We demonstrate significant improvements when pretraining on 11 languages, with gains of up to 2 BLEU points over strong baselines. We also show gains of up to 12 BLEU points over cross-lingual transfer baselines in data-constrained scenarios. All code and pretrained models will be released as further steps towards larger reproducible benchmarks for African languages."

This success comes despite the fact that there is no explicit objective to align the contextual embeddings of words/sentences with similar meanings across languages together in the same space. In this paper, we present a new method for learning multilingual encoders, AMBER (Aligned Multilingual Bidirectional EncodeR). AMBER is trained on additional parallel data using two explicit alignment objectives that align the multilingual representations at different granularities. We conduct experiments on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning for different tasks including sequence tagging, sentence retrieval and sentence classification. Experimental results on the tasks in the XTREME benchmark (Hu et al., 2020) show that AMBER obtains gains of up to 1.1 average F1 score on sequence tagging and up to 27.3 average accuracy on retrieval over the XLM-R-large model which has 3.2x the parameters of AMBER.

To this end, we introduce the Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders XTREME benchmark, a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the cross-lingual generalization capabilities of multilingual representations across 40 languages and 9 tasks. We demonstrate that while models tested on English reach human performance on many tasks, there is still a sizable gap in the performance of cross-lingually transferred models, particularly on syntactic and sentence retrieval tasks. There is also a wide spread of results across languages. We release the benchmark to encourage research on cross-lingual learning methods that transfer linguistic knowledge across a diverse and representative set of languages and tasks."

Despite impressive empirical results and an increasing interest in massively multilingual models, theoretical analysis on translation errors made by such universal machine translation models is only nascent. In this paper, we formally prove certain impossibilities of this endeavour in general, as well as prove positive results in the presence of additional (but natural) structure of data. For the former, we derive a lower bound on the translation error in the many-to-many translation setting, which shows that any algorithm aiming to learn shared sentence representations among multiple language pairs has to make a large translation error on at least one of the translation tasks, if no assumption on the structure of the languages is made. For the latter, we show that if the paired documents in the corpus follow a natural \emph{encoder-decoder} generative process, we can expect a natural notion of ``generalization'': a linear number of language pairs, rather than quadratic, suffices to learn a good representation. Our theory also explains what kinds of connection graphs between pairs of languages are better suited: ones with longer paths result in worse sample complexity in terms of the total number of documents per language pair needed. We believe our theoretical insights and implications contribute to the future algorithmic design of universal machine translation."

In this paper, we investigate how to utilize visual content for disambiguation and promoting latent space alignment in unsupervised MMT. Our model employs multimodal back-translation and features pseudo visual pivoting in which we learn a shared multilingual visual-semantic embedding space and incorporate visually-pivoted captioning as additional weak supervision.

In this paper, we argue that this is a dual effect of the highly lexicalized nature of NMT, resulting in failure for sentences with large numbers of unknown words, and lack of supervision for domain-specific words. To remedy this problem, we propose an unsupervised adaptation method which fine-tunes a pre-trained out-of-domain NMT model using a pseudo-in-domain corpus. Specifically, we perform lexicon induction to extract an in-domain lexicon, and construct a pseudo-parallel in-domain corpus by performing word-for-word back-translation of monolingual in-domain target sentences. In five domains over twenty pairwise adaptation settings and two model architectures, our method achieves consistent improvements without using any in-domain parallel sentences, improving up to 14 BLEU over unadapted models, and up to 2 BLEU over strong back-translation baselines.",

Our approach allows the model to assign domain-specific representations to words and output sentences in the desired domain.

In this paper, we propose the framework of \textit{Domain Differential Adaptation (DDA)}, where instead of smoothing over these differences we embrace them, directly modeling the difference between domains using models in a related task. We then use these learned domain differentials to adapt models for the target task accordingly.

The main goal of the tool is to give the user a high-level and coherent view of the salient differences between systems that can then be used to guide further analysis or system improvement. It implements a number of tools to do so, such as analysis of accuracy of generation of particular types of words, bucketed histograms of sentence accuracies or counts based on salient characteristics, and extraction of characteristic n-grams for each system. It also has a number of advanced features such as use of linguistic labels, source side data, or comparison of log likelihoods for probabilistic models, and also aims to be easily extensible by users to new types of analysis. compare-mt is a pure-Python open source package, that has already proven useful to generate analyses that have been used in our published papers.

Methods to predict interpreter confidence and the adequacy of the interpreted message have a number of potential applications, such as in computer-assisted interpretation interfaces or pedagogical tools. We propose the task of predicting simultaneous interpreter performance by building on existing methodology for quality estimation (QE) of machine translation output. In experiments over five settings in three language pairs, we extend a QE pipeline to estimate interpreter performance (as approximated by the METEOR evaluation metric) and propose novel features reflecting interpretation strategy and evaluation measures that further improve prediction accuracy.",

The first part uses an embedding layer to represent words and their part-of-speech tags in both languages. The second part leverages a one-dimensional convolution layer to integrate local context information for each target word. The third part applies a stack of feed-forward and recurrent neural networks to further encode the global context in the sentence before making the predictions.

  abstract={Undersampling is a widely adopted method to deal with imbalance pattern classification problems. Current methods mainly depend on either random resampling on the majority class or resampling at the decision boundary. Random-based undersampling fails to take into consideration informative samples in the data while resampling at the decision boundary is sensitive to class overlapping. Both techniques ignore the distribution information of the training dataset. In this paper, we propose a diversified sensitivity-based undersampling method. Samples of the majority class are clustered to capture the distribution information and enhance the diversity of the resampling. A stochastic sensitivity measure is applied to select samples from both clusters of the majority class and the minority class. By iteratively clustering and sampling, a balanced set of samples yielding high classifier sensitivity is selected. The proposed method yields a good generalization capability for 14 UCI datasets.},

  abstract={Classifying binary imbalanced streaming data is a significant task in both machine learning and data mining. Previously, online area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) maximization has been proposed to seek a linear classifier. However, it is not well suited for handling nonlinearity and heterogeneity of the data. In this paper, we propose the kernelized online imbalanced learning (KOIL) algorithm, which produces a nonlinear classifier for the data by maximizing the AUC score while minimizing a functional regularizer. We address four major challenges that arise from our approach. First, to control the number of support vectors without sacrificing the model performance, we introduce two buffers with fixed budgets to capture the global information on the decision boundary by storing the corresponding learned support vectors. Second, to restrict the fluctuation of the learned decision function and achieve smooth updating, we confine the influence on a new support vector to its k-nearest opposite support vectors. Third, to avoid information loss, we propose an effective compensation scheme after the replacement is conducted when either buffer is full. With such a compensation scheme, the performance of the learned model is comparable to the one learned with infinite budgets. Fourth, to determine good kernels for data similarity representation, we exploit the multiple kernel learning framework to automatically learn a set of kernels. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmark data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.},

    abstract = {Online learning from imbalanced streaming data to capture the nonlinearity and heterogeneity of the data is significant in machine learning and data mining.  To tackle this problem, we propose a kernelized online imbalanced learning (KOIL) algorithm to directly maximize the area under the ROC curve (AUC).  We address two more challenges: 1) How to control the number of support vectors without sacrificing model performance; and 2) how to restrict the fluctuation of the learned decision function to attain smooth updating.  To this end, we introduce two buffers with fixed budgets (buffer sizes) for positive class and negative class, respectively, to store the learned support vectors, which can allow us to capture the global information of the decision boundary.  When determining the weight of a new support vector, we confine its influence only to its $k$-nearest opposite support vectors.  This can restrict the effect of new instances and prevent the harm of outliers.  More importantly, we design a sophisticated scheme to compensate the model after replacement is conducted when either buffer is full.  With this compensation, the learned model approaches the one learned with infinite budgets.  We present both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental comparison to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed KOIL.},

  abstract={User-generated reviews on mobile applications (apps) are a valuable source of data for developers to improve the quality of their apps. But the reviews are usually massive in size and span over multiple topics, thus leading to great challenges for developers to efficiently identify the key reviews of interest. In recent studies, automatic user review mining has been recognized as a key solution to address this challenge. The existing methods, however, require extensive human efforts to manually label the training data. Besides, they only analyze the static characteristics over the whole set of collected reviews, while ignoring the dynamic information embedded in the reviews of different time periods. In this paper, we propose 'AR-Tracker', a new framework to mine user reviews without the need of human labeling and track the dynamics from the top-ranked reviews. Through extensive experiments on the reviews of four popular mobile apps collected over 7 months, we show that AR-Tracker can still achieve comparable accuracy with the state-of-the-art methods, e.g., AR-Miner. Additionally, a case study on Facebook reviews further validates the effectiveness of 'AR-Tracker' in tracking the dynamics.},

We further define a robot language and use a generative machine translation model to translate robotic commands from natural language to robot language. The main purpose of this paper is to simulate the interaction process between human and robots using crowdsourcing platforms, and investigate the possibility of translating natural language to robot language with paraphrases.},

We also extend the idea of fine-grained gating to modeling the interaction between questions and paragraphs for reading comprehension. Experiments show that our approach can improve the performance on reading comprehension tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the Children's Book Test dataset. To demonstrate the generality of our gating mechanism, we also show improved results on a social media tag prediction task.},
