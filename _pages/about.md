I am an assistant professor with appointments in the Department of Biostatistics, Department of Computer Science and Data Science Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I obtained my Ph.D. from School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with Jaime Carbonell and Graham Neubig. 

I have a broad interest in <b>natural language processing</b> and <b>machine learning</b>. My research goal is to build robust intelligent AI agents that adapt rapidly to dynamic environments and communicate effectively with people speaking different languages. In particular, my research focuses on algorithmic design and fundamental understanding of machine learning models in NLP that enable safe deployment in the wild. Most recently, I'm fascinated by understanding behaviors of large language models (LLMs), adapting them effectively to knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, and aligning them safely with users from diverse backgrounds. My specific topics of interest include the following aspects of LLMs:

<ul>
  <li><b style="color:#bb0000;">Multilingual NLP and Cultures</b>: Democratizing inclusive LLMs across languages and cultures while enhancing pluralistic alignment. </li>
  <li><b style="color:#bb0000;">Efficient Multimodal LLMs</b>: Developing efficient multimodal LLMs for high-stakes applications in education and healthcare.</li>
  <li><b style="color:#bb0000;">Cognitive Language Agents</b>: Unifying cognitive concepts and languages to enable complex reasoning, planning and human behavior simulation.</li>
  <li><b style="color:#bb0000;">Evaluation and Mechanistic Interpretation</b>: Exploring robust methods for evaluating and interpreting black-box foundation models.</li>
</ul> 


<b style="color:#bb0000;">Prospective PhD students (Updated on Jan 9 2025)</b>: Thanks for your interest! I may not be able to reply to all inqueries due to the large amounts of emails. If you still want to bring my attention to your papers by email, please add <b style="color:#bb0000;">"[prospective student to Hulab]"</b> in the email subject. I'll update hiring information on my website. <b style="color:#bb0000;">I am looking for 1 or 2 creative and curiosity-driven PhD students to join our lab in the fall of 2025</b>. The admission decision at UW-Madison is committee-based. Please apply to the [CS](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/graduate/graduate-admissions-faq/) or [BDS](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/education/current-students/phd-bds/) program, and mention my name in your application and research statement. UW-Madison is an excellent place for research, and Madison is a wonderful city to live in. Please check out these videos (Why [UW-Madison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cRE4F8GOBE), [Madison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJA5alrisQ?)). 

<b style="color:#bb0000;">Prospective MS/BS students and interns</b>: I'm also happy to work with master's or undergraduate students at UW-Madison. If you are a currently UW student, please email me your CV. At the beginging of some semesters, I typically send an email to the CS mailing list to find students for research projects. Selected candidates will participate in a brief interview and will be paired with one of my PhD students. For international students, I consider only exceptional candidates with closely aligned research interests. Please contact me at least <b style="color:#bb0000;">5 months before your onsite internship</b> to allow time for paperwork and review the [J-1 student internship](https://iss.wisc.edu/j-1-student-interns/) program requirements.
