I am an assistant professor with appointments in the Department of Biostatistics, Department of Computer Science and Data Science Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I obtained my Ph.D. from School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with Jaime Carbonell and Graham Neubig. 

I have a broad interest in <b>natural language processing</b> and <b>machine learning</b>. In particular, I work on multilingual NLP, transfer learning, multimodal learning, and their applications to support human-machine communications. My research goal is to build robust intelligent systems that evolve with changes in the environment and interact with people speaking different languages.

<b>Prospective students</b>: Thanks for your interest! I am always looking for excellent PhD students to join our lab. Please apply to the [CS](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/graduate/graduate-admissions-faq/) or [BDS](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/education/current-students/phd-bds/) program, and mention my name in your application and research statement. UW-Madison is an excellent place for research, and Madison is a wonderful city to live in. Please check out these videos (Why [UW-Madison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cRE4F8GOBE), [Madison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJA5alrisQ?)). I'm also happy to work with masters or undergraduate students at UW-Madison. If you are interested, please send me an email.
