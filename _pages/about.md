I am an assistant professor with appointments in the Department of Biostatistics, Department of Computer Science and Data Science Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I obtained my Ph.D. from School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with Jaime Carbonell and Graham Neubig. 

I have a broad interest in <b>natural language processing</b> and <b>machine learning</b>. My research goal is to build robust intelligent systems that evolve with changes in the environment and interact with people speaking different languages. In particular, my research focuses on algorithmic design and fundamental understanding of machine learning models in NLP that enable safe deployment in the wild. Most recently, I'm fascinated by understanding behaviors of large language models, adapting them effectively to knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, and aligning them safely with users from diverse backgrounds. Specific topics of interest include the following aspects of large language models:

<ul>
  <li>Multilingual/multimodal representation learning from self-supervision </li>
  <li>Unifying LLMs with knowledge graphs for structured reasoning</li>
  <li>Evaluation and interpretation of black-box foundation models</li>
  <li>Language models as agent for task executions</li>
</ul> 


<b style="color:#bb0000;">Prospective students (Updated on Nov 10 2023)</b>: Thanks for your interest! I may not be able to reply to all inqueries due to the large amounts of emails. If you still want to bring my attention to your papers by email, please add <b style="color:#bb0000;">"[prospective student to Hulab]"</b> in the email subject. I'll update hiring information on my website. <b style="color:#bb0000;">I am looking for ~2 excellent PhD students to join our lab in the fall of 2024</b>. Please apply to the [CS](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/graduate/graduate-admissions-faq/) or [BDS](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/education/current-students/phd-bds/) program, and mention my name in your application and research statement. UW-Madison is an excellent place for research, and Madison is a wonderful city to live in. Please check out these videos (Why [UW-Madison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cRE4F8GOBE), [Madison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJA5alrisQ?)). I'm also happy to work with masters or undergraduate students at UW-Madison. If you are interested, please send me an email.
